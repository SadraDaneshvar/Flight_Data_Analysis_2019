<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 13pt;">

In this GitHub repository, you will find the culmination of a data analysis project centered around airline ticket data. The dataset comprises various attributes, including user IDs, purchase dates and times, ticket information, airline codes, source and destination codes, and pricing details. The primary objective of this project is to extract meaningful insights from this data through Python-based analysis, leveraging libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and computation.

The project revolves around answering a series of questions and fulfilling specific objectives to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset. Below, we outline the key inquiries we aim to address:

* Monthly Buying and Selling Analysis: We seek to calculate the average monthly expenditure and revenue for each customer while examining whether these metrics are influenced by the specific day of the month when the purchase was made. This entails converting Gregorian dates to their corresponding day values.

* Customer Club Points: To determine the most esteemed customers, we set a purchase threshold, such as transactions exceeding 900,000 tomans, and assign points based on these criteria.

* Sales Analysis by Day and Time: We analyze sales patterns across different days of the week and hours of the day to pinpoint the most and least popular timeframes for transactions.

* Purchase and Ticket Date Analysis: This analysis centers around the temporal gap between purchase and ticket issuance, categorized by months. We aim to unveil insights into customer behavior and supplier service levels.

* Popular Routes: Identifying the most frequented routes is essential. We delve into this aspect and explore the relationships between these popular routes and their corresponding origins and destinations.

* Airlines Performance Analysis: We scrutinize the popularity and profitability of airlines, scrutinizing variations across different months, origins, and destinations to inform resource allocation decisions.

Each of these questions is tackled using Python programming and Pandas data manipulation, with the results and insights documented in the respective sections of this repository. By addressing these questions, we aim to provide valuable insights that can guide decision-making processes within the context of the airline industry. It is essential to remember that the responsible and ethical use of data is paramount, ensuring compliance with all privacy regulations and ethical guidelines.
